# Climate-Smart Irrigation Model  

## Overview  

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks designed to simulate crop growth and soil processes under different irrigation strategies:  

- **Drip irrigation**  
- **Sprinkler irrigation**  
- **Rainfed cropping**  

Each notebook performs a growing season simulation of:  
- Vertically integrated soil moisture dynamics  
- Crop biomass growth  
- Soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  

All code cells are thoroughly commented for clarity. The notebooks take as input a NumPy array representing rainfall distribution (ax an example input, **200 seasons of a typical 140-day growing season of rainfall**).  

## Model Context  

For the simulations, we use soil, weather, and crop parameters representative of the **Texas High Plains**, a major agricultural region in the United States that relies heavily on irrigation for sustainable production.  

A detailed discussion of the model structure and its mathematical formulation is provided in the supporting information for the manuscript. Please refer to that document for in-depth explanations.  

This Python code was developed to run simulations for a submitted manuscript that introduces a **dual-index framework** to evaluate trade-offs between **productivity** and **soil GHG emissions (climate impact)** across different irrigation practices.  

- The manuscript is currently under revision at *Earthâ€™s Future*.
